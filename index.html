        <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly Most markup languages are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).</p>
        <p>We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML. Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) Windows 8 or later: Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad. Windows 7 or earlier: Open Start-> Programs -> Accessories -> Notepad</p>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design a webpage to make it attractive. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.

            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>

        <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as scripting language for web pages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>

        <p>standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published. Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language.</p>

        <h2>React</h2>
        <p>React is a JS framework by the team at Facebook used to build web user interfaces, especially for single page applications. React is very reactive as the name suggestsâ€”you can build small to very large applications that updates the DOM without page reloads. It was built to be very fast, declarative and easy to learn React uses virtual DOM, a good way to create faster web apps. The components can also easily be reused and a component can contain multiple smaller components in it. It is also easier to create dynamic applications on the web using React instead of Vanilla JS. React has a suite of tools that make you comfortable using it, from a robust community to dedicated debugging tools and extensions in your favorite IDEs</p>

          <h2>WebAssembly</h2>
          <p>supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support). Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in all browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers supported that way. Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use languages such as Rust, C or C++ or in theory any language, that compile to it.</p>
